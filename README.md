# HyperV

## To-Do

### Try creating and destroying Hyper-V Windows machines using PowerShell

Test out this: create a VM, install Windows 10 on it from the ISO, boot it up,
install some program (like Firefox and/or something from alongside the script),
run the program and collect its output, close and destroy the VM.

Measure how long this will take as well.
